# ArduinoRegex

This is slightly improved version of ArduinoRegex library writen by Nick Gammon. It can be found here: https://github.com/nickgammon/Regexp

In my work I don't like numbers. I think that named group is better and more human readable. So I added to this library named groups. As side effect - it can't work without Arduino STL (can be found here: http://andybrown.me.uk/wk/2011/01/15/the-standard-template-library-stl-for-avr-with-c-streams/ ).

I don't very good programmer so this library can cause memory leak and it's code isn't perfect. So, I warned you! =)
